# Emerald
_Emerald_ is a simple programming language.
## About
_Emerald_ is written in C++. I want it to be a powerful but small language, just like a tool. But I do not want it to be a scripting language. I hope that _Emerald_ has its own compiler and runtime, maybe an interpreter. It should be **Object Oriental** (which means it has **classes**, **interfaces**, **methods**, **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, etc). It should be **quite readable**.
## Developing
This project may develop in a slow rate. But I'll do it. For now I shall continue improving its ```lexer```, and start developing its ```parser```. ðŸ˜†
